MiniMoka Gnome Shell Theme
==========================


This is a minimalistic clean theme for the Gnome Shell. It is meant to match the beautiful Moka Icon and GTK themes, which you can find at the [Moka Project website](http://mokaproject.com/).


MiniMoka is brought to you by Ossi Hanhinen, [@ohanhi](https://twitter.com/ohanhi), and is distributable under the [GNU GPL v3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) terms apart from the workspace switcher icons (see below).
