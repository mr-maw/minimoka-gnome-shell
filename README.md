MiniMoka Gnome Shell Theme
==========================


This is a minimalistic clean theme for the Gnome Shell. It is meant to match the beautiful Moka Icon and GTK themes, which you can find at the [Moka Project website](http://mokaproject.com/).


MiniMoka is brought to you by Ossi Hanhinen, [@ohanhi](https://twitter.com/ohanhi), and is distributable under the [GNU GPL v3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) terms apart from the workspace switcher icons (see below).

## Installing

Simply unzip the `minimoka-gnome-shell.zip` file's content into either **~/.themes** or **/usr/share/themes**. You can then select the Shell theme using Tweak Tool, provided you have the **User themes** extension.

If you want the customized [Dash to dock](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/) styles seen in the screenshots, save the `[DashToDock/stylesheet.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mr-maw/minimoka-gnome-shell/master/DashToDock/stylesheet.css)` file in the extension's directory: **~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/dash-to-dock@micxgx.gmail.com/**.



## Screenshots

*All screenshots have the aforementioned Moka Icon and GTK themes in use. The wallpaper is artwork by the talented [Justin M. Maller](http://justinmaller.com/).*
